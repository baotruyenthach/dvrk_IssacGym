Release Notes
##############

1.0.preview1
=============

New Features
-------------

- Implemented end-to-end GPU pipeline for physics simulation, which allows interacting with simulations on the GPU without copying data to or from the host.
- Added new Tensor API for physics state and control, on both CPU and GPU.
- Added Pytorch interop utilities for the Tensor API.
- Added a new simple framework for reinforcement learning and a collection of sample tasks.
- Added new configurable domain randomization features.
- Added support for fixed and spatial tendons with PhysX.
- Added support for user-defined force sensors attached to articulation links with PhysX.
- Exposed DOF forces in PhysX.
- Added Jacobian and generalized mass matrices with PhysX.
- Improved PVD support - can connect to PVD remotely or log to file.
- Improved contact handling with multiple substeps.
- Added support for multiple subscenes to parallelize computations with CPU PhysX.
- Improved contact handling performance in PhysX.
- Support for rigid dynamic actors in PhysX to increase performance with single-body actors.
- Support for custom aggregates with PhysX.
- Exposed joint armature and joint friction in PhysX.
- Added support for soft contacts with Flex.
- Added stress tensors with Flex.
- Added pneumatic pressure/target tensors with Flex.
- Added soft materials with Flex.
- Added new simulation and asset/actor options for Flex and PhysX.
- Parsing tendon definitions from MJCF.
- Loading cylinder geometry from MJCF.
- Loading visual meshes from MJCF.
- Generating filters from contact specification in MJCF.
- Improved support for multiple sensor cameras per env.
- Improved Z-up simulation support.
- Updated PhysX and FleX versions.
- Viewer sync can be toggled by pressing V (disabling sync increases performance, especially with the GPU pipeline).
- Improved setup scripts.
- Updated documentation and examples.
- Updated docker images.

Removed Features
-----------------

- Removed Python multiprocessing support, which is superseded by the new Tensor API.
- Removed old ``rlbase`` module and examples, which are replaced by the new RL framework designed around the Tensor API.
- Removed old RTX renderer.

Changes
--------

- Renamed package from ``carbongym`` to ``isaacgym``.
- Improved quaternion-Euler conversion utilities.

Bug Fixes
----------

- Numerous physics bug fixes and simulation stability improvements.
- Fixes and improvements to URDF and MJCF importers.
- Fixes and improvements to camera sensors.

Known Issues and Limitations
-----------------------------

- Most of the rigid body tensor API is only available with PhysX.
- Soft body support is currently only available with FleX.
- Missing tensor API for setting all rigid body states: root and DOF state tensors can be used instead.
- Missing API for configuring properties of spatial tendons.
- URDF importer still doesn't support loading STL and DAE meshes, only OBJ.
- When using the GPU pipeline, DOF states don't refresh in the viewer.
